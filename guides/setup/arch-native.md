# Install necessary stuff

(I recommend `wine-staging` if your distro has it, but usual `wine` works as well.)

If asked, replace `jack`.

```
# If you use pipewire, I also recommend to install: pipewire-jack-client
# If you use pulseaudio, I also recommend to install: pulseaudio-jack
sudo pacman -S jack2 lib32-jack2 realtime-privileges qjackctl

# the groups should already exist, but just in case
sudo groupadd audio
sudo groupadd realtime
sudo usermod -aG audio $USER
sudo usermod -aG realtime $USER
```

Log out and back in. Or reboot, if that doesn't work.

<details><summary> How to check if this worked correctly</summary>

> For the packages, do `pacman -Q <package-name>` (You can do multiple packages at once). Should output the names and versions without errors.
>
> For the groups, run `groups`. This will give you a list, which should contain "audio" and "realtime".
</details>

# Create a clean prefix

Set the Proton version you want to use. There's two ways to do this. In Steam

* go to `Settings` ➞ `Compatibility` ➞ `Enable Steam play for all other titles`, then restart Steam.
* open your library, right click Rocksmith and go to`Properties` ➞ `Compatibility` and force one.

Delete or rename `$STEAMLIBRARY/steamapps/compatdata/221680`, then start Rocksmith and stop the game once it's running.

The rest will be set up later.

## Install

Installing `base-devel` is very useful for using the AUR and compiling in general.

</details>

[Download](https://github.com/wineasio/wineasio/releases) the newest .tar.gz and unpack it. Open a terminal inside the newly created folder.



```
# build
rm -rf build32
rm -rf build64
make 32
make 64

# Install on normal wine
sudo cp build32/wineasio32.dll /usr/lib32/wine/i386-windows/wineasio32.dll
sudo cp build32/wineasio32.dll.so /usr/lib32/wine/i386-unix/wineasio32.dll.so
sudo cp build64/wineasio64.dll /usr/lib/wine/x86_64-windows/wineasio64.dll
sudo cp build64/wineasio64.dll.so /usr/lib/wine/x86_64-unix/wineasio64.dll.so
```



`wineasio` is now installed on your system.

## Make use of

To make Proton use wineasio, we need to copy these files into the appropriate locations.

**STOP!** If you haven't set the environment variables yet, please follow [this part](/README.md#common-paths) of the prerequisites, then continue.

```
cp /usr/lib32/wine/i386-unix/wineasio32.dll.so "$PROTON/lib/wine/i386-unix/wineasio32.dll.so"
cp /usr/lib32/wine/i386-windows/wineasio32.dll "$PROTON/lib/wine/i386-windows/wineasio32.dll"
cp /usr/lib/wine/x86_64-unix/wineasio64.dll.so "$PROTON/lib64/wine/x86_64-unix/wineasio64.dll.so"
cp /usr/lib/wine/x86_64-windows/wineasio64.dll "$PROTON/lib64/wine/x86_64-windows/wineasio64.dll"
```

In theory, this should also work with Lutris runners (located in `$HOME/.local/share/lutris/runners/wine/`)

To register wineasio (so that it can be used in the prefix), run the `wineasio-register` script that comes in the wineasio zip and set the `WINEPREFIX` to Rocksmiths.

```
env WINEPREFIX=$STEAMLIBRARY/steamapps/compatdata/221680/pfx ./wineasio-register
```

Errors outputted by this command are expected. The important one is the message at the end saying "regsvr32: Successfully registered DLL ..." or "regsvr32: Failed to register ...".

## Installing RS_ASIO

1. [Download](https://github.com/mdias/rs_asio/releases) the newest release, unpack everything to the root of your Rocksmith installation (`$STEAMLIBRARY/steamapps/common/Rocksmith2014/`)
1. Edit RS_ASIO.ini: fill in `wineasio-rsasio` where it says `Driver=`. Do this for every Output and Input section. You could also fill in `WineASIO` instead.

And you're done with RS_ASIO. But in case you want to configure the inputs further (relevant for multiplayer), see [this](/guides/setup-rs-asio.md).

## Set up JACK

Open QjackCtl and go to "Setup". Select

1. Driver: alsa
1. Tick "Realtime"
1. Sample Rate: 48000
1. Frames/Period: 256 (my recommendation)
1. Periods/Buffer: 4 (my recommendation)
1. Select audio device as described below.

If you use the same device for input and output, you can set it in the "Parameters" 🡲 "Interface".

If you use one device for input and one for output (say, RealToneCable and internal soundcard for example), select them in the "Advanced" Tab, as "Output Device" and "Input Device". The number of channels below are usually selected automatically

Quick note on Frames and Buffer size: More frames equals better quality audio. More Buffer equals more stability. Higher numbers equal higher latency. 256/4 is decent audio with decent delay and works for most people.

Press apply, close setup and try to start JACK.

# Starting the game

![](/img/3-start-button.webp)

Delete the `Rocksmith.ini` inside your Rocksmith installation. It will auto-generate with the correct values. The only important part is the `LatencyBuffer=`, which has to match the Buffer Periods.

Steam and JACK need to be running.

If we start the game from the button that says "Play" in Steam, the game can't connect to wineasio (you won't have sound and will get an error message). This is an issue with Steam and pipewire-jack. There are two ways to go about this. You can apply both at the same time, they don't break each other.



<details><summary>1. LD_PRELOAD</summary>

* Advantages: Run from Steam directly
* Disadvantages: higher possibility of crashes, steps you might need to do every game-boot.

Add these launch options to Rocksmith:
```
LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib32/libjack.so %command%
```

You can launch the game from Steam now. For the first few boot-ups, you have to remove window focus from Rocksmith (typically done with Alt+Tab) as soon as the window shows up. If it doesn't crash, continue with instructions.

If there is NO message saying "No output device found, RS_ASIO is working fine. If you can hear sound, everything works fine.

If you cannot hear sound, open QjackCtl and go to "Graph". We want to connect microphones to the inputs of Rocksmith and two outputs to our actual output device. Rocksmith will sometimes crash when messing with the patchbay. I recommend connecting everything before entering a profile.

<details><summary>2. Start script, shortcut in Steam</summary>

* Advantage: Reliable one time setup
* Disadvantages: Another Steam game entry, or having to launch from terminal entirely

### Get the start script

Please select the Proton Version you use (Rocksmith has been working fine since at least Proton 4 btw):

* [Proton 9 or higher](/guides/start-script/proton-9.md) (newer versions)
* [Proton 8 or lower](/guides/start-script/proton-8.md) (slightly easier)

We can start the game via this script now: `path/to/rocksmith-launcher.sh`



If you want the Steam overlay to work, you need to launch the script via Steam, see the next step.

### Making it nice via Steam entry (optional, but recommended)

With Proton's runtime, we can't start Rocksmith directly from the Steam Library just like that (excluding LD_PRELOAD). But we can use the Steam Library to start the script that starts the game in a way that Steam recognizes.

<details><summary>Fitting meme format</summary>

![](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/002/546/187/fb1.jpg)

</details>

Go into your Steam Library and select "Add a game" ➞ "Add a Non-Steam Game" on the bottom left.

Make sure you can see all files. Select the script we generated just now and add it. This will create a shortcut to the script, which I will refer to as "shortcut" from here on. For Proton versions 8 or lower, right click on the shortcut and select "Properties". Add these launch Options: `PIPEWIRE_LATENCY="256/48000" %command%`

You can now start the game from Steam. Use the shortcut, it will launch the actual game.

<details><summary>If launching the script from Steam doesn't work</summary>

You can try and add it to Lutris, then add a Lutris shortcut by right-clicking and selecting "Create Steam shortcut".

This works because of how Lutris behaves when games are launched from Steam. All the Steam shortcut does is to notify Lutris to start a game. This is finished when Lutris received the message (= Steam sees it as "stopped"). Lutris then launches the game.

Important Settings:

* Runner: Linux
* Working Directory: The folder where your script is.
* Disable Lutris Runtime: true

</details>

### Beautification (even more optional, but recommended)

Leaving the shortcut just like that is not pretty, so we're going to change that.

You can give the games in your Steam Library a custom look. A good Website for resources is the [SteamGridDB](https://www.steamgriddb.com/).

You can take artwork from [Rocksmith](https://www.steamgriddb.com/game/1841), [Rocksmith 2014](https://www.steamgriddb.com/game/2295), [Rocksmith+](https://www.steamgriddb.com/game/5359161) or anything else you want. I would recommend something that makes the shortcut look different than the game.

**Name and icon:** Go into the shortcut's Properties. Right under the text "Shortcut" you can change the game's icon and name (both show up in the list on the left in desktop mode). I recommend something like "Rocksmith 2014 - Launcher".

**"Hero (banner/background)":** Located above the "Play" button in Steam. Right-click on it and choose "set custom background". You can theoretically set a logo too by right-clicking on the text, but I personally chose not to do that to clearly see which item is which.

**Grid (cover art):** For this it gets a bit harder. Go to `$HOME/.steam/steam/userdata/<number>/config/grid`. Since we added a hero, there should be a file that resembles it, so find it with an image viewer. It's called `<id>_hero.<file-ending>` we need the ID.
copy the cover art into this folder and name it `<id>p.<file-ending>`.

This is how the files look on my system:

![](/img/grid-file.webp)

Launch Big Picture Mode now and find the entry in your Library. It should now have artwork.
