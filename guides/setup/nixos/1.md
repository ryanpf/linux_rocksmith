# JACK to ASIO with pipewire on NixOS

Thanks to [TimP4w](https://github.com/TimP4w) for writing this.

This guide is unmaintained, because it's significantly different than the other ones and Nizo doesn't understand NixOs-specific stuff. If you want to help, go ahaed and create pull-requests, or issues with instructions on what to change.

# Tested and working with
```
NixOS 25.05.804113.6c64dabd3aa8 (Warbler) [64-bit]
Wineasio: wineasio-1.2.0
Pipewire Jack: pipewire-1.4.2-jack
RS_ASIO 0.7.4
Proton: Proton - Experimental
```

# NixOS Configuration

## Assumptions
- You have steam (`programs.steam.enable = true;`) installed
  - This is very important, because we need steam that comes with its own `FHS` environment AND `steam-run` to be able to execute commands in this environment.
- You use the pipewire service from nixpkgs (`services.pipewire.enable = true;`)

After applying the configuration, reboot your PC.


## Minimal Configuration
```nix
  ### Audio
  sound.enable = true;

  services.pipewire = {
    enable = true;
    jack.enable = true;
  };


  ### Audio Extra
  security.rtkit.enable = true; # Enables rtkit (https://directory.fsf.org/wiki/RealtimeKit)

  #
  # domain = "@audio": This specifies that the limits apply to users in the @audio group.
  # item = "memlock": Controls the amount of memory that can be locked into RAM.
  # value (`unlimited`) allows members of the @audio group to lock as much memory as needed. This is crucial for audio processing to avoid swapping and ensure low latency.
  #
  # item = "rtprio": Controls the real-time priority that can be assigned to processes.
  # value (`99`) is the highest real-time priority level. This setting allows audio applications to run with real-time scheduling, reducing latency and ensuring smoother performance.
  #
  security.pam.loginLimits = [
    { domain = "@audio"; item = "memlock"; type = "-"; value = "unlimited"; }
    { domain = "@audio"; item = "rtprio"; type = "-"; value = "99"; }
  ];

  # Add user to `audio` and `rtkit` groups.
  users.users.<username>.extraGroups = [ "audio" "rtkit" ];

  environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [
    qpwgraph # Lets you view pipewire graph and connect IOs
    pavucontrol # Lets you disable inputs/outputs, can help if game auto-connects to bad IOs
    unzip # Used by patch-nixos.sh
    rtaudio
  ];

  ### Steam (https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Steam)
  programs.steam = {
    enable = true;
    package = pkgs.steam.override {
      extraLibraries = pkgs: [ pkgs.pkgsi686Linux.pipewire.jack ]; # Adds pipewire jack (32-bit)
      extraPkgs = pkgs: [ pkgs.wineasio ]; # Adds wineasio
    };
  };

```

### Explanation

We of course want mainly two things: audio and Steam.
These are pretty much self-explanatory, but there are some more settings that we need:

#### Audio

We use pipewire (`services.pipewire`) and pipewire-jack. The goal is to connect jack to wine via wineasio.

I noticed that for audio we need some extra things:
- rtkit: without this the game just crashes
- PAM loginLimits: we also need to set some limits here for the audio group to access real-time scheduling with a higher priority.
- user groups: we add our user to the `audio` and `rtkit` groups to enable these limits for us
- `qjackctl` to control our audio pipeline (there are also other alternatives here, such as `helvum` or `qpwgraph`)


#### Steam
Here we only want to add two things:
- wineasio, to connect JACK with wine
- The 32-bit libraries of pipewire JACK since Rocksmith is a 32-bit game.

NixOS is not using the [FHS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_Hierarchy_Standard) convention however the official steam program is packaged with its own FHS environment. So what we are doing is to add an extra library (`pkgsi686Linux.pipewire.jack`) to the default environment that comes from nixpkgs. For `wineasio` we only need some `.dll` and `.so` files that we usually need to compile. However if we install it via nixpkgs, this is done automatically and we can later copy the generated files (see below).

# Choose your method

You must apply the configuration and rebuild your system _BEFORE_ continuing.

## Method 1 - Manual

Everything is done by hand.

## Method 2 - Automated Script

A script that does almost everything automatically is provided in this repo.
